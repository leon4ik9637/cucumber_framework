    Background vs. Scenario vs. Scenario Outline vs
    Data Table

    Scenario: it is a single test script in feature file.
    Scenario runs only once.

    Scenario Outline: It is always followed with an
    Examples table.
    Scenario Outline helps us to execute same scenario
    with different data sets

    Background: allows us to execute common steps
    before each Scenario in the feature file

    Data table:
